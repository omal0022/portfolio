### Final Assignment - Digital Portfolio

	> "Tell us about your process, challenges you faced during development and how you overcame those changes. What have you learned by creating your web portfolio?"

I began putting together my portfolio website by adding all of the elements I needed for each page to the html and then going through and using Bootstrap to style each section. For certain things like the main "hero" image on the main page I decided that a grid layout would work better for what I wanted. I was trying to achieve an overlap of the text and image as the screen size increases. When I couldn't get Bootstrap to work for me I would default to the CSS knowledge I had such as flex and grid. 

I tried to find a CSS library/framework to use to create the "masonry" style of gallery that you see everywhere but found it very difficult to find one without some form of JS element. I am not confident enough to use JS so I kept searching and eventually found a CSS only version of this style. While it isn't perfect, and I hope to learn a lot more about Javascript next year, it seems to do the trick. 

I was challenged quite a bit during this process. I found a lot of the Bootstrap elements looked great, but not for what I was trying to achieve. I was able to style most of them to my liking, but I found myself rewatching class videos and googling *a lot* I think that this type of process can seem really daunting and frustrating in the moment, but will really help to solidify the knowledge for me. 

I have learned so much building this website. Specifically Bootstrap and also that you may have to make changes to your original mockup for accessibility and ease of use. I've also learned that building a website from scratch takes a lot of time, patience and Google - but boy is it satisfying!
